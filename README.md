# Pantheon

This project has been in my mind since high school and has gone through countless of complete reworks. All these characters are based on the novel that I'm currently working on named [Freedom Cry](https://vincascalvii.github.io/freedom).

As you are aware of, the layout and abilities greatly resemble the online battle arena game called League of Legends. I've been playing the game since I was in grade 11 and the champion designs have been one of the coolest things from it (except Teemo).

I really want to work on a game like League of Legends one day and wish that I can see my characters coming to life.

Anyway, have a look and tell me what you think about the design.
